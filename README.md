## Usage

- with docker compose (**recommended**)

```
services:
  coquo:
    container_name: coquo
    image: atocqueville/coquo:latest
    ports:
      - 3030:3000
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
    environment:
      - AUTH_URL=**insert your production domain**/api/auth
      - AUTH_SECRET="insert a hash secret"
```

### Add Google Sign In Provider

To enable Google Sign In, you'll need to set up OAuth credentials in the Google Cloud Console:

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project** (if you don't have one):
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one

2. **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials**:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
   - Select "Web application" as the application type
   - Add:
     - Authorized Javascript origins: `https://yourdomain.com`
     - Authorized redirect URIs: `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/google`

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
```
 services:
  coquo:
    container_name: coquo
    image: atocqueville/coquo:latest
    ports:
      - 3030:3000
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
    environment:
      - AUTH_URL=****
      - AUTH_SECRET=****
      - AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=your_google_client_id
      - AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
```

**Note**: Make sure your `AUTH_URL` environment variable matches your production domain for the OAuth callbacks to work correctly.

## Development

Start the development server (using pm2):

```bash
yarn install
yarn prisma:reset # Remove your eventual existing database, creates an empty one and plays migrations

yarn dev:start # Start the Coquo web app on port 3000 + Prisma Studio on port 5555
```

Stop the development server:

```bash
yarn dev:stop
```

You can then log in with the combo `alex@admin.io` / `azerty` at http://localhost:3000
